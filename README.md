🌌 Journey – Fullscreen Background Video Website

Journey is a simple, visually appealing landing page project that demonstrates how to use a fullscreen background video to create a modern, immersive user experience. The project is built entirely with HTML5 and CSS3, making it lightweight, responsive, and easy to customize for personal or professional use.

The core of this project is the fullscreen video background that automatically plays, loops, and covers the entire screen regardless of the device or aspect ratio. Using the object-fit: cover property ensures that the video always adapts to the viewport, providing a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. To enhance readability, a dark gradient overlay is applied, allowing the text and call-to-action button to stand out without compromising the video’s visual impact.

At the center of the screen, the project displays a bold “Journey” heading with a hover effect that transforms the text into a stroked outline, adding a touch of interactivity. Just below, the “Explore” button serves as a call-to-action, styled with hover transitions for a smooth user experience. Together, these elements demonstrate how a simple design can be both engaging and elegant.

The layout leverages flexbox to ensure proper centering and responsiveness, while media queries adjust the video scaling depending on the device’s aspect ratio. This makes the design versatile and suitable for landing pages, portfolio sites, event promotions, or any creative showcase.

This project is ideal for beginners learning how to integrate video backgrounds into web pages, as well as for designers looking for a quick, modern starting template. It is completely open-source, easy to modify, and ready for deployment.
